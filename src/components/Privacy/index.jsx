        <h1 className="privacy__main-title">EasyBank TERMS OF USE</h1>
        <p className="privacy__text">EasyBank Technologies, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively "EasyBank," "we," or "us") welcome you. This page explains the terms by which you may use the banking and other financial services we make available to you on our website or on our mobile application (the "App," together with the Site and banking and financial services, collectively the "Services"). By accessing or using our Services, or otherwise manifesting your assent to these Terms of Use (the "Agreement"), you signify that you have read, understood and agree to this Agreement and our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. Additionally, by submitting your application to obtain an account with us ("Account"), you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by, the Deposit Account Agreements of the banking service provider for your account. You also agree to receive all notices and other communications from us electronically. EasyBank reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to these terms and will provide notice of these changes by posting an updated version to our legal page. "Company" or "You" means the legal entity that is applying for or that has opened an Account to use the Services and the individual applying for the Account. If you are the individual applying for the Account, you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of Company with the authority to bind Company to this Agreement ("Administrator"), and that you agree to this Agreement on Company’s behalf.</p>
        <p className="privacy__text">PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.</p>
      </span>

      <span className="privacy__paragraph">
        <h2 className="privacy__title">1. Use of the Services</h2>
        <p className="privacy__text">Eligibility. This is a contract between you and EasyBank. You must read and agree to these terms before using the Services. If you do not agree, you may not use the Services. You may only apply for an Account, and use the applicable Services under such Account, if you are a legal entity formed and registered in the United States and can form a binding contract with EasyBank. You may only use the Services in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. Except with respect to access to our Site, any use of or access to the Services for consumer or non-commercial purposes by any individual who is not your employee, contractor, agent, or other individual permitted to use your Account on your behalf ("User") is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement.</p>
        <p className="privacy__text">Applying for an Account. Your Account gives you access to certain Services, the demand deposit account ("Deposit Account") and debit cards ("Cards") provided by one of our financial institution providers ("Banking Provider"), and any other functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. You will need to provide Company information and certain personal information (collectively, "Company Information"), when you apply for an Account. Company Information may include your registered business name and state of incorporation, the business address, ownership details, the nature of the business, and other business information we may request from time to time; the name, contact information, and date of birth of Administrators, Users or beneficial owners, and other personal information; and a corporate registration certificate, proof of address, personal identification, and any other documentary information used to verify business and personal information.  </p>
        <p className="privacy__text">We provide Company Information to our Banking Providers and other third-party service providers to determine your eligibility for access to certain Services. We rely on the accuracy of the Company Information you provide us when opening and maintaining your Account. We may deny your applications, suspend provision of such Services to you, or close your Account if Company Information is out of date, incomplete, or inaccurate.</p>
        <p className="privacy__text">Account Management and Security. You must specify at least one Administrator to manage your Account when submitting your Application. Administrators can add, remove, or manage additional Administrators and Users; request and manage Cards for Users; view transactions and run reports; provide or update Company Information; connect third-party services, and other accounts to your Account; and perform other tasks to manage your Account. You are responsible for any actions or failure to act on the part of Administrators or Users, or those using their credentials to access your Account. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Account, and you must keep your Account password secure. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (for recommendations on what constitutes a strong password, check the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)) with your Account. You must notify EasyBank immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account. EasyBank will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your Account. We may suspend access to your Account if we believe that your Account has been compromised.</p>
        <p className="privacy__text">Prohibitions. You may agree that you will not: (a) use the Account or the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by this Agreement; (b) use the Account or the Services for any personal, family, household, or other use that is not related to Company’s business purpose; (c) use the Account or the Services for the benefit of an individual, organization, or country identified on the United States Office of Foreign Asset Control’s Specially designated Nationals List, (d) use the Account or the Services for any third parties unaffiliated with Company, (e) use the Account or the Services to collect any market research for a competing business, (f) impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity, (g) interfere with or attempt to interrupt the proper operation of the Services through the use of any virus, device, information collection or transmission mechanism, software or routine, or access or attempt to gain access to any EasyBank IP, data, files, or passwords related to the Services through hacking, password or data mining, or any other means; (h) decompile, reverse engineer, or disassemble any software or other products or processes accessible through the Services; (i) circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade, or thwart any of the Content protections in the Services; (j) use any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means to access the Services for any purpose without our express, written permission; provided, however, we grant the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the public portions of the Services for the sole purpose of, and solely to the extent necessary for, creating publicly-available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials; and (k) take any action that imposes or may impose (in our sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our technical infrastructure.</p>

      <span className="privacy__paragraph">
        <h2 className="privacy__title">10. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</h2>
        <p className="privacy__text">Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Services shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Services shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. Subject to Section 9B, you agree that the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the Arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p>
        <p className="privacy__text">Arbitration. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM MERCURY. For any claim, dispute, or controversy with EasyBank (a "Claim"), you agree to first contact us at legal@easybank.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that EasyBank has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, such dispute will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party. NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website www.jamsadr.com. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Claim immediately after commencement of the arbitration. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights. Proceedings and information related to them will be maintained as confidential, including the nature and details of the Claim, evidence produced, testimony given, and the outcome of the Claim, unless such information was already in the public domain or was independently obtained. Company and EasyBank, and all witnesses, advisors, and arbitrators will only share such information as necessary to prepare for or conduct arbitration or other legal proceeding, or enforcement of the outcome, unless additional disclosure is required by law.</p>
        <p className="privacy__text">Class Action Waiver. You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Claims between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Claim to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Claim to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>

If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.</p>
        <p className="privacy__text">No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and EasyBank’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
        <p className="privacy__text">Legal Orders. We may respond to and comply with any subpoenas, warrants, liens, or any other legal order we receive related to your use of the Services. We are not responsible to you for any losses you incur due to our response to such legal order. We may hold funds or provide information as required by the issuer of the legal order or take any other actions we believe are required of us under legal orders. Where permitted, we will provide you reasonable notice that we have received such an order.</p>
        <p className="privacy__text">Survival.
